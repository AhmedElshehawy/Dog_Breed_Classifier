# Dog Breed Classifier App
## This notebook is about building dog breed classifier, and to add some fun to it, it will display the most resembling dog breed if a human image is passed to it
### Steps:
* We need to build dog detector, and human face detector.
* Next we will build a CNN from scratch to classify the dog breeds.
* Then we will build a CNN using transfer learnig and compare results to choose the best one. 


The task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.

It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).

Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.

And random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%. 

### So I'm only targeting 70% accuracy or higher.
